    <h3>  Is this a weight loss product? </h3>
       <p> No and Yes. Your body was designed to burn fat as
         its primary source of fuel. But a diet that contains
         large amounts of sugar, trans fats, and processed foods
         can shift you from a fat burner to a carb burner.
         The “Reset” Bar is the most nutritionally complete
         whole food product for supporting a “normal” fat
         burning metabolism. This occurs when we consume
         the foods that support the proper balance and
         function of your fat producing and fat burning hormones and
         we eliminate or dramatically reduce the foods that inhibit this balance.
          This is actually considered the optimal health food plan for reducing
          the risks of all diet related concerns. One dynamic benefit of this
          plan is the aggressive and sustainable reduction of body fat. When
          your hormones begin working for you instead of against you, the health
           benefits are numerous, and one
           of the most profound is normal weight.</p>
